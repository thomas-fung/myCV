# Research Interest
- My research interests include
    - (Integer-valued) Time Series Analysis
    - Flexible Regression
    - Conway-Maxwell Poisson (CMP) and related distributions
    - Variance-Gamma and related distributions
    - Tail dependence
- My research is motivated by complex data that exhibit deviations from an assumed model, such as dispersion, zero-inflation, skewness and heavy-tailedness.
