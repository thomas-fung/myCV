\section{Research Interest}
\begin{itemize} 
\item My research interests include 
\begin{itemize}
\item (Integer-valued) Time Series Analysis
\item Flexible Regression
\item Conway-Maxwell Poisson (CMP) and related distributions
\item Variance-Gamma and related distributions
\item Tail dependence
\end{itemize}
\item  My research is motivated by complex data that exhibit deviations from an assumed model, such as dispersion, zero-inflation, skewness and heavy-tailedness. 
\end{itemize}
